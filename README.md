# Solar Recommendation System
This project aims to develop a solar recommendation system that can help users find the best solar panels for their specific needs. The system will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's land size and other relevant factors to provide personalized recommendations. The system will also be able to predict the performance of the solar panels based on the user's location and other environmental factors. The system will be deployed on a cloud platform and can be accessed through a web interface.

# Problem Statement
Across multiple industries, decision-making is often manual, time-consuming, and based on outdated methodologies. This project introduces AI-driven solutions to:

1.Recommend the most efficient solar panels based on location and environmental factors.
2.Provide accurate land and house price predictions for real estate investors.
3.Estimate construction costs dynamically to prevent budget overruns.
4.Enhance communication between clients and interior designers for more efficient project execution.
