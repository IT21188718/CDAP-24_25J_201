# Project Components

# Solar Recommendation System
This project aims to develop a solar recommendation system that can help users find the best solar panels for their specific needs. The system will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's land size and other relevant factors to provide personalized recommendations. The system will also be able to predict the performance of the solar panels based on the user's location and other environmental factors. The system will be deployed on a cloud platform and can be accessed through a web interface.

# Land and House Price Prediction System
This machine learning-based system predicts land and house prices in Colombo, considering factors such as location, land size, amenities, and market trends. It aims to assist real estate investors, developers, and buyers in making informed decisions by offering data-driven price estimations. The system will use historical data and real-time market trends to generate predictions.

# Cost Estimation for Construction Projects
This project introduces a smart construction cost estimation system that provides real-time budget predictions using historical data and live inputs. By applying machine learning algorithms, the system will dynamically adjust cost estimates based on material prices, labor costs, and evolving project conditions. This innovation aims to improve financial planning, reduce risks, and prevent cost overruns.

# Interior Design Collaboration Platform
The Interior Design Collaboration Platform streamlines communication between clients and interior designers by integrating text and image-based inputs. This interactive design dashboard enables clear, real-time feedback, reducing inefficiencies and misunderstandings. The system improves the design decision-making process by utilizing AI-powered recommendations and visualization tools.
