## Overall Research Description

This research presents a **Machine Learning Based Automated Construction Planning System** tailored for the Sri Lankan construction sector. The system integrates four main components to enhance planning and decision-making:

1. **Solar Recommendation System**
   Uses machine learning to analyze land dimensions, site positions, and environmental data to recommend optimal solar panel designs and forecast system output, promoting renewable energy adoption.

2. **Land and House Price Prediction System**
   Leverages historical and real-time Colombo real estate market data to predict property prices accurately, assisting developers, investors, and buyers in data-driven investment decisions.

3. **Construction Cost Estimation System**
   Applies machine learning models to forecast project budgets by analyzing material costs, labor, and project environment variables, aiming to reduce financial uncertainties and overruns.

4. **Interior Design Collaboration Platform**
   Facilitates AI-powered interaction between clients and designers through recommendation systems and interactive visualization, improving design accuracy and communication.

The integrated system leverages diverse machine learning techniques including Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Neural Networks, and Natural Language Processing to optimize construction planning, cost efficiency, sustainability, and stakeholder collaboration in Sri Lankaâ€™s construction industry.
